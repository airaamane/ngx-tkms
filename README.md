## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server.
this will concurrenlty do two things: 

- Start an express server on `http://localhost:3000/` where the API lives
- Start the Angular app on `http://localhost:4200/` 

 Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
